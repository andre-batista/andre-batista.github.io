The library **eispy2d** is now released! This is an open-source Python library for developing and testing algorithms for Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems (EISPs). We provide tools to generate problems, to build algorithms, and to results analysis. The library was intended to save time from having to develop the whole structure to represent an EISP instance and to share new ideas by developing new methodologies and making them available for comparison and general studies.
